# Hough-Transform
In this project, I implemented some basic image processing algorithms and putting them together to build a Hough Transform based line detector.

Files:

 1. myImageFilter: impelemtnatation of "imfilter" or "conv2".
 
 2.myEdgeFilter: do the edge detection using "sobel filter" and "non-maximum suppression".
 
 3.myHoughTransform: applies the Hough Transform to an edge magnitude image. 
 
 4.myHoughLines:uses the Hough transform output to detect lines.
